# Uber-Rides-Analysis

I recently explored Uber rides data using Python, uncovering several interesting insights that shed light on travel patterns and user preferences. Hereâ€™s a summary of key findings:

1. **Travel Purpose and Category**:
   - **Business vs. Personal**: Most rides were booked for business purposes, indicating a significant demand for transportation related to work engagements.
   - **Popular Purposes**: Meetings and Meals/Entertainment were the top reasons for booking rides, highlighting common activities among users.

2. **Time Analysis**:
   - **Preferred Time**: The majority of rides were booked during the afternoon (10 am - 5 pm), suggesting peak demand during business hours.
   - **Day-Night Classification**: Utilizing a day-night classification, we observed that afternoon rides were the most frequent.

3. **Monthly Trends**:
   - **Seasonal Variations**: Rides fluctuated throughout the year, with fewer rides during the winter months (Nov, Dec, Jan), likely due to colder weather impacting travel behavior.

4. **Correlation Insights**:
   - **Category Correlation**: Business and Personal categories showed a strong negative correlation, underscoring the distinction in travel purposes between these categories.
   - **Feature Correlation**: Overall, there was minimal correlation between features, suggesting that ride bookings were influenced by diverse factors.

5. **Data Preprocessing and Visualization**:
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Null values in the purpose column were filled with "NOT" to maintain data integrity.
   - **Visualization Techniques**: Utilized matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing categorical counts, time-based trends, and correlation matrices.

### Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into Uber ride patterns, reflecting user behaviors and preferences across different categories and timeframes. The findings underscore the importance of data-driven decision-making in optimizing service delivery and customer satisfaction in the transportation sector.
